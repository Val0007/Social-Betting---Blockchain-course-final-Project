**Social Betting : On-Chain betting for small groups**


## Category
**Smart Contract protocol**

## Description
This project introduces a decentralized social betting platform designed for small groups of friends or communities. Users can create custom bets as smart contracts, lock funds on-chain, and rely on smart contracts to handle outcomes and payouts transparently. The payouts will be based on the pari-mutuel system where the payout depends on how risky the bets are . The creator of the bet will be the trusted oracle. Once the outcome has been known from the owner , the bet stops and the payout is distributed to the participants, the workflow is trustless, permissionless, and fully verifiable on the blockchain.

Relevance
While there are many betting platforms , this projects focuses on creating a betting platform where users can easily create bets on chain and make their friends and family pariticipate either on the testnet or on the mainnet .
